Shield Our Senior: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Shield Our Seniors app for Android!

This app was developed through a collaboration between The Elder Financial Safety Center at The Senior Source of Dallas, a non-profit that serves aging adults; UNT Dallas College of Law; University of North Texas at Dallas School of Human Services; and Dallas County District Attorneyâ€™s Office.This app provides easy access to information, education, and training to anyone who has frontline access to older adults. Abuse can be physical, financial, and emotional. Please use this app as a resource for information about the Texas penal code; Texas civil statutes and definitions; warning signs of abuse; and resources relating to aging individuals.

We take privacy very seriously. 

We hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that we have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Firebase is used to keep track of app crashes and type of devices that use the app itself for future improvements.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently overlooked, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send us an email.

Yours sincerely,
The Senior Source
