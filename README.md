Welcome to the Shield Our Seniors app for Android! 

This app was developed through a collaboration between The Elder Financial Safety Center at The Senior Source of Dallas, a non-profit that serves aging adults; UNT Dallas College of Law; University of North Texas at Dallas School of Human Services; and Dallas County District Attorneyâ€™s Office. This app provides easy access to information, education, and training to anyone with frontline access to older adults. Abuse can be physical, financial, and emotional. Please use this app as a resource for information about the Texas penal code; Texas civil statutes and definitions; warning signs of abuse; and resources relating to aging individuals. 

As a responsible app developer, we take privacy very seriously. Privacy is our top priority.  

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Firebase is used to keep track of app crashes and the type of devices that use the app for future improvements. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently overlooked or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send us an email at app@theseniorsource.org.   

No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, as there is no guarantee of absolute security. If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, please email us at app@theseniorsource.org.
